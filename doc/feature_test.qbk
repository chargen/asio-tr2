[section Feature test macros (Informative)]
[xrefid feature.test]

These macros allow users to determine which version of this Technical
Specification is supported by the headers defined by the specification. All
headers in this Technical Specification shall supply the following macro
definition:

  #define __cpp_lib_experimental_network yyyymm

If an implementation supplies all of the conditionally-supported features
specified in [xref conformance.conditional], all headers in this Technical
Specification shall supply the following macro definition:

  #define __cpp_lib_experimental_network_extensible yyyymm

[std_note The value of the macros `__cpp_lib_experimental_network` and
`__cpp_lib_experimental_network_extensible` is `yyyymm` where `yyyy` is the
year and `mm` the month when the version of the Technical Specification was
completed.]
