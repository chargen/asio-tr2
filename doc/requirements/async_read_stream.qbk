[section:async_read_stream Buffer-oriented asynchronous read stream requirements]

In the table below, `a` denotes an asynchronous read stream object, `mb`
denotes an object satisfying [link requirements.mutable_buffers mutable buffer
sequence] requirements, and `t` is a completion token.

    [`a.get_io_service();`]
    [`io_service&`]
    [Returns the `io_service` object through which the `async_read_some`
    copmletion handler will be invoked.]

      The return type is determined according to the requirements for an

      with completion signature `void(error_code ec, size_t n)`.\n
      \n
      Initiates an asynchronous operation to read one or more bytes of data
      from the stream `a`.\n
      \n
      If successful, `n` is the number of bytes read and `ec` is set such that
      `!ec` is true. If an error occurred, `n` is `0` and `ec` is set such that
      `!!ec` is true. If all data has been read from the stream and the stream
      has been shut down in an orderly manner, `n` is `0` and `ec` is set such
      that `ec == stream_errc::eof`.\n
      \n
      The operation shall complete immediately if `buffer_size(mb) == 0`.
