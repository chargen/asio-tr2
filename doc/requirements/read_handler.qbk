[section:read_handler Read handler requirements]

A read handler must meet the requirements for a [link requirements.handler
handler]. A value `h` of a read handler class should work correctly in the
expression `h(ec, s)`, where `ec` is an lvalue of type `const error_code` and
`s` is an lvalue of type `const size_t`.
