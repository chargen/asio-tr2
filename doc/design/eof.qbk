[section Why EOF is an error]

* The end of a stream can cause `read`, `async_read`, `read_until` or
  `async_read_until` functions to violate their contract. E.g.
  a read of N bytes may finish early due to EOF.

* An EOF error may be used to distinguish the end of a stream from a successful
  read of size 0.
